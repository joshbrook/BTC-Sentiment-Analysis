# Analysis of New Words on Twitter

## Abstract
***A max 150-word description of the project question or idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?***

Initially, we came up with the Idea to compare Data sets of tweets on twitter between 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 with specific emphasis on the new words used on the platform in the time period.

We have not decided on a specific question yet but we considered looking into what new words and whether the public sentiment has shifted in a more negative or positive way relative to previous years.

We hope to be able to run through a full NLP pipeline and implement machine learning algorithms particularly ones centered on Neural Networks to showcase their superior ability in handling large data sets while improving on existing architectures.

## Research questions
***A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.***

Analysis of new words on Twitter by comparing data from 2020-2021 and data from 2021-2022 and seeing from the sentiment of the new words whether public opinion has shifted in a more positive, neutral, or negative way as compared to previous years. 

## Dataset
***List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show you've read the docs and are familiar with some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.***

Here we hope to use the Corona_Nlp_train/test datasets from the last assignment as well as some other datasets we can find which have similar or more relevant data.

We may also make use of the [UCC](https://github.com/conversationai/unhealthy-conversations) (The Unhealthy Comments Corpus), which contains > 40,000 online comments whcih have been tagged with sentiment values. This may be useful for exploring further how new words are used and what sentiment they tend to contribute to.

[This](https://academictorrents.com/details/85a5bd50e4c365f8df70240ffd4ecc7dec59912b) data comprised of reddit comments may alos be useful, especially for gauging in what contexts and online subcultures our new words are used.
