# Analysis of New Words on Twitter

## Abstract
***A max 150-word description of the project question or idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?***

Initially, we came up with the Idea to compare Data sets of tweets on twitter between 2020-2021 and 2021-2022 with specific emphasis on the new words used on the platform in the time period.

We have not decided on a specific question yet but we considered looking into what new words and whether the public sentiment has shifted in a more negative or positive way relative to previous years.

Another idea that we considered was using sentiment analysis from a dataset about a topic and to see how it compares to the behaviour of the said topic. For example, comparing the sentiment of a person of relevance/interest or from a community, about a specific security ( gold, cryptocurrecy, stocks, real estate etc.) or inflation/ Federal Reserve rate hikes, to try to correlate their sentiment with the security's  perfomance and see if it has any  predictive value.

We hope to be able to run through a full NLP pipeline and implement machine learning algorithms particularly ones centered on Neural Networks to showcase their superior ability in handling large data sets while improving on existing architectures.

## Research questions
***A list of research questions you would like to address during the project.***

Analysis of new words on Twitter by comparing data from 2020-2021 and data from 2021-2022 and seeing from the sentiment of the new words whether public opinion has shifted in a more positive, neutral, or negative way as compared to previous years. 

## Dataset
***List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show you've read the docs and are familiar with some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant.***

Here we hope to use the Corona_Nlp_train/test datasets from the last assignment as well as some other datasets we can find which have similar or more relevant data.

We may also make use of the [UCC](https://github.com/conversationai/unhealthy-conversations) (The Unhealthy Comments Corpus), which contains > 40,000 online comments whcih have been tagged with sentiment values. This may be useful for exploring further how new words are used and what sentiment they tend to contribute to.

[This](https://academictorrents.com/details/85a5bd50e4c365f8df70240ffd4ecc7dec59912b) data comprised of reddit comments may alos be useful, especially for gauging in what contexts and online subcultures our new words are used.

Datasets  containing Ethereum based currency, Apple's stock  discussions and overall discussions on cryptocurrency. These datasets are relatively new and offer both comments and posts with their scores and for the comments, their sentiment analysis.
