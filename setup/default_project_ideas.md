# Default project ideas

This is but a limited selection of project ideas you can chose from. They all have a question or topic, a dataset or an idea on how to get one, and an idea of the methods to be used. Further refining them into a plan is part of your project too. You are encouraged to propose your own project.

## Media and politics

### Social media politics

How election campaigns unfold on social media? Pick one or more campaign and track how different candidates engage with certain topics during the campaign. Datasets: news, Twitter.

### How are Bible (or Quran etc.) quotes used on Twitter?

A simple but important question, given the role of religion in society. Inspiration: [America's Public Bible](http://americaspublicbible.org/). Dataset: news, Twitter.

### Media polarity

Media are often supporting an agenda on their own. Can this agenda be discovered by analysing how differently they report the same news? Build a polarity profile for different media, considering a choice of the variety of datasets available.

### Globalization of the news

The world is becoming increasingly connected. Does the trend toward globalization also exist in the news? If so, since when? Detect and describe the ratio between international and local events through the years in a dataset of news.

## Science of science

### The languages of science

How different is the language of scientists from everyday language? Collect a dataset of abstracts from different scientific disciplines and learn a language model for each of them. Assess their distance from a baseline model learned from news or Wikipedia. Dataset: arXiv, PubMed OA, JSTOR, ask me.

### Science and hype

Are scientists hyping their results? Find a way to measure hype, and check if it is increasing over time. Dataset: arXiv, PubMed OA, JSTOR, ask me.

### Mapping machine learning research

Detect trends in machine learning research over the past years/decades. Dataset: arXiv.

### Recommending research

Build a recommender system for scientific publications based on their contents and a user query. Dataset: arXiv, PubMed OA, JSTOR.

## Languages

### Impact of major events on language

What effect does an event like the COVID-19 pandemic or a war have on our language? Are new terms introduced and does the meaning of words change? Twitter would be a good source for this.

### Language change over time

Are there words that have acquired a different meaning over the years? Try to learn some diachronic word embeddings from texts of different time periods and find out. Historical newspaper corpora would be a good source for this.

### Text mining for lexical semantics and critical discourse analysis

Words don't always mean what it says in the dictionary. What is the difference between an immigrant and an expat? Are certain activities more associated with particular genders in our AI language models? Data-driven language models can show you their bias.

### Comparing computational language models to human language processing

Can text mining tell us anything about how humans process language? Are utterances that are difficult for language models to process, also difficult for humans to process? Or conversely, can language models tell us which texts are easier to read and which ones are more difficult to read?

### Text mining for low-resource languages

Most of language data is in English, and so most text mining methods work best for English. But there is interesting information encoded in other languages too. Can you build a text mining method that already exists for English, for another language that does not yet have it?

## Domains of language

Perform an analysis of the language of the following categories of documents, using language models, sentiment analysis, clustering and any other technique you like. Try to come up with a question you would like answered.

### Philosophical texts

### Newspaper text

### Tweets

### Films

### Songs

### Books

### Food
